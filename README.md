## Blurb
In the wonderful world of Hereva, the young Pepper lives with her cat Carrot in a small house in the depths of the forest of Squirrel's End. Their specialty: making magic potions ! An activity which involves a lot of risks since, in them, preparations, incantations and other invocations quickly tend to degenerate... Share the hectic daily life of this witch today in a series of short stories at the heart of a universe of fantasy fun and offbeat made of potions, creatures, magic ... but above all humor !

With Pepper and Carrot, David Revoy originally developed a free, free and open-source webcomic, funded directly by his readers on the principle of patronage.
