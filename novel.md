### Chapter 1 - The Potion of Flight
A young witch stood in the middle of a dimly lit room over a cauldron that was bubbling away. She was wearing a scrawny brown dress, with patches all over it. With a pointed hat covering her black hair, her face lit up as she said, **"...and the last touch"**, and poured a multi-colour powder into the sizzling metal bowl. The expression on her face turned from smiley to confused. **"...mmm probably not strong enough"**, she said as she stared deeply between the cauldron and the box she was pouring from. She then closed her eyes, tipped the box upside down and let all the contents spill out into the boiling liquid below. There was an explosion of bright golden colours, as the laddle flew into the air. **"ha... perfect"** she exclaimed as she grabbed hold of the broomstick next to her. Her orange cat looked shocked, as though it didn't expect this potion would work.
